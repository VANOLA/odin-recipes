        <p>This soup is a vegetarian lentil soup. I decided to use french green lentils because 
            they are particularly suited for soups and stews. This soup feels like a big bowl 
            of comfort and is perfect for a fall day. 
        </p>

        <p>The secret ingredient in this soup is a parmesan rind! It adds a perfect, subtle 
            complexity that is often missing in soups. However, feel free to omit if necessary.
            You may also substitute the rind of any other hard cheese such as asiago, or parmigiano
            reggiano. Now you have a reason to save the rinds of your parmesan cheese wedges! They 
            freeze perfectly well. I hope you enjoy this soup.
         </p>

                <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                <li>1.5 cups green (French) lentils</li>

                <li>6 cups of vegetable stock, storebought is fine</li>

        </div>   
         <h3>Preparation</h3>

         <div class="list">
            <ol>
                <li>In a dutch oven over medium heat, heat up the olive oil. Add the onions with the 
                    salt and pepper, and saute until the onions are transluscent and fragrant, about
                    4-5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Add the carrots, celery, and potatoes. Saute for another 8-10 minutes, or until 
                    tender. Add the garlic, cumin, and thyme, and saute for another 30 seconds. Stir 
                    continuously to avoid burning the garlic.
                </li>
                <li>Add the lentils, and deglaze the pan with crushed tomatoes and vegetable stock.
                    Stir in the parmesan cheese rind if using, and simmer soup for 30 minutes, or until
                    lentils are tender. Adjust salt and pepper if necessary.
                </li>
                <li>Enjoy alone or with crusty bread!</li>
